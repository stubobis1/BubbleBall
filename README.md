# BubbleBall
HTML5 game, move left and right to avoid getting hit. This repo includes step-by-step branches to walk you through how I built this game.

## Tutorial Steps
- **Step 1** - create an empty canvas and the basic html/css setup
- **Step 2** - draw the player and instructions once
- **Step 3** - set up the main loop and make the player move
- **Step 4** - define and generate obstacles but don't draw them yet
- **Step 5** - draw and update the obstacles so they move
- **Step 6** - add hit detection and logic to end the game
- **Step 7** - add scoring

## Next steps and suggestions for improvement
This is a simple game I built in under two hours. There are lots of things you could make more efficient and lots of new features you could add. Here are some ideas:

- add new types of obstacles
- make the obstacle generator start slow and speed up the longer you play
- keep the highscore in localStorage so that you can close the window and still see your highscore (until you delete your storage)
- set up a database and api endpoint for storing the scores long-term
- create a high scores page
